### Analysis

* An interactive dashboard has been created with global filters as ```attrition```, ```Department``` and ```Job Role```. 

* A ```Years since last promotion vs years in current role``` chart has been made to see which cluster of employees, if being disgruntled or due to limited/stagnant growth oppurtunity, has left the company. Findings highlights area of concern being employees leaving job within 0-2 years of promotion. Two clusters can be visually identified which needs a little digging into.

* ```Attrition vs Job Role``` bar plot shows top 4 attrition happening for Lab Technician, Sales Executive, Research Scientist and Sales Representative. Department wise analysis shows 
R&D Dept having highest rate of attrition. HR should talk to R&D Head and try to understand the underlying cause why the top talent pool is leaving organisation .Is it due to infrastructure , compensation, policies, the work or the manager ? 

* Treemap for understanding ```attrition with years with current manager``` to understand the work bonding between employee and manager and relationship with attrition, if any. Attrition is high in 0th(attrtion before even a year), 2nd, 7th year. Is this due to work pressure and stringent targets new employee can't cope up with? 2nd and 7th year may be due to better offers in competitor companies. Retention measures should be taken for employees with satisfactory KPI.

* Area Chart to understand relationship between ```attrition and number of companies``` an employee worked to understand the experience vs attrition graph. Attrition rate is in general on higher side if the employee worked for only 1 company (assuming the column is denoting total companies worked and not companies worked before) , highest at 31 attrtion for Lab tech, 23 for Sales Rep, 19 for Research Scientist and 12 for Sales Executives.
